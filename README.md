# 🎵 Music Recommendation System

A **Data Science-based Music Recommendation System** that suggests music tracks using **Machine Learning techniques**.  
It combines **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to recommend music based on user preferences and track characteristics.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎯 **Content-Based Recommendation**  
  Recommends music by analyzing features like genre, artist, mood, and tempo.

- 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering**  
  Suggests music based on user-item interactions (e.g., listening history or ratings).

- 📊 **Data-Driven Approach**  
  Applies core data science techniques to clean, analyze, and model music data.

- ⚙️ **Model Implementation**  
  Built using Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Pickle.

- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**  
  Applies feature extraction and cleaning techniques to prepare data for modeling.

## 📝 Dataset

The dataset includes metadata for music tracks (genre, artist, tempo, mood)  
along with user preferences (listening history or ratings).  
This data is used to generate personalized music recommendations.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Data Processing**  
   Clean and transform raw music/user data into structured formats.

2. **Model Training**  
   - *Content-Based Filtering:* Recommends similar tracks using **Cosine Similarity**.
   - *Collaborative Filtering:* Suggests music based on behavior of similar users.

3. **Music Recommendation**  
   Based on selected track or user input, the system suggests top relevant songs.

## 🛠️ Example Use Case

- User selects or inputs a song they like  
- System analyzes its features and matches similar tracks  
- Displays list of recommended music with optional album info via Spotify API
