Song Recommendation System 🎵
A Data Science-based Song Recommendation System that suggests songs using Machine Learning techniques. It applies content-based filtering and collaborative filtering with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for accurate recommendations. 🚀🎵

📌 Features
Content-based recommendation: Recommends songs based on the features of the songs (like genre, artist, tempo, etc.) and user preferences.
Collaborative filtering: Uses user-item interactions (such as ratings or listening history) to recommend songs that similar users have liked.
Data-driven approach: Utilizes data science techniques to process and analyze song and user data.
Model implementation: Built using Python, with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Pickle.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are applied to transform raw data into usable formats for building recommendation models.

1. Navigate to the project directory:   
   
       cd song-recommendation-system  

2. Install the required dependencies:   
     
       pip install -r requirements.txt
     
🔧 Usage
Load the song data and user preferences from the provided dataset.
Train the recommendation model using content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.
Use the trained model to recommend songs based on user input or listening history.

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Pickle: For saving and loading the model and similarity matrix.

📝 Data
The dataset includes various songs and their features (like genre, artist, tempo) and user preferences (such as listening history or ratings). This data is used to generate personalized song recommendations.

💡 How it Works
Data Processing: The system loads and preprocesses the song and user preference data.
Model Training: The recommendation model is trained using content-based filtering (based on song features) and collaborative filtering (based on user preferences).
Recommendation: Once the model is trained, it suggests songs that are most similar to the user's preferences.
🛠️ Example
To get song recommendations based on a user’s preferences, simply input the user’s song history or preference data, and the system will generate a list of suggested songs.
